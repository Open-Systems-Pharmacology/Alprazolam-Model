The presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of a PBPK model for alprazolam in healthy adults.

Alprazolam, sold under the trade names Xanax and Solanax, among others, belongs to the group of benzodiazepines and is commonly used in short term management of anxiety disorders. It is generally administered orally as immediate release or extended release tablet, but other forms are also available, e.g. solution or sublingual tablet.

Following oral administration, alprazolam is rapidly absorbed with an absolute bioavailability ranging from 80% to 100% ([Greenblatt 1993](#5-references)). Absorption is independent of the dose and the relative bioavailability of solid and liquid dosage forms has been observed to be similar ([Dawson 1984](#5-references)). Alprazolam is widely distributed throughout the body and its free fraction in plasma, averaging around 30%, is not influenced by total alprazolam concentrations within the tested range of 0.01 to 10 mg/L ([Moschitto 1983](#5-references)). Alprazolam is extensively metabolized to various metabolites ([von Moltke 1993](#5-references)). The two major metabolites, Î±-hydroxy-alprazolam and 4-hydroxy-alprazolam, are formed through oxidation catalyzed by CYP3A ([Eberts 1980](#5-references), [von Moltke 1993](#5-references)). Within 72 h of a 2 mg oral dose of <sup>14</sup>C-alprazolam, 20% of the dose have been observed to be excreted unchanged in urine ([Eberts 1980](#5-references)). Alprazolam displays dose linear pharmacokinetics and does not accumulate during multiple dose treatment ([Dawson 1984](#5-references), [Greenblatt 1993](#5-references)). Because of the predominant role of CYP3A4 in alprazolam elimination, alprazolam is often used as victim compound in drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies.

The presented alprazolam PBPK model was developed for intravenous (IV) administration and oral (PO) administration of the immediate release tablet (Xanax) or extended-release formulation (Solanax) given in fasted state in healthy, non-obese adults; administration in fed state was not addressed here.
