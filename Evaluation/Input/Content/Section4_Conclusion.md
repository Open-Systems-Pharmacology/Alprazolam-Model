The final alprazolam PBPK model applies metabolism by CYP3A4, modelled as two separate pathways catalyzed by the same enzyme yielding Î±-hydroxy-alprazolam and 4-hydroxy-alprazolam as metabolites, and glomerular filtration. Overall, the model adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam in healthy, non-obese adults receiving different single doses of alprazolam via the IV route or oral route as immediate release tablet in the fasted state.
