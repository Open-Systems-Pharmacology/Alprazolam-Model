This repository contains:

- a PK-Sim snapshot (*.json) file of the current PBPK model
- static content (e.g. text blocks, *.md files) as inputs for an evaluation plan
- an evaluation plan (evaluation-plan.json) to create an evaluation report using the snapshot and static text blocks to display the performance of the model

**The latest release of the snapshot of the model, the evaluation plan and the static content can be found [here](../../releases/latest).**

**The latest release of the PK-Sim project model file and the respective evaluation report can be found [here](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSP-PBPK-Model-Library/releases/latest).**



This alprazolam model is intended to be used as victim drug in CYP3A4-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDI).

This whole-body PBPK model of alprazolam has been developed based on clinical data ontained from the literature for intravenous (IV) administration and oral (PO) administration of immediate release tablets or extended-release formulation given in fasted state in healthy, non-obese adults. In total, 24 clinical studies were used for model development and evaluation. 
Further information can be found [here](../../releases/latest).
